  <h1>Low‑poly Rat Simulator</h1>
  <div class="prose">
    <p>Experience life as a mischievous rat exploring a stylized 3D environment. Collect bones while navigating obstacles using ragdoll physics and tunnel mechanics. I designed and implemented the gameplay in Unity, built levels with URP, and integrated a dynamic camera using Cinemachine. This project highlights my creativity and proficiency with C# and Unity.</p>
