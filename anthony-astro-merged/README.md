# Anthony Grummett — Merged Portfolio

This is the merged Astro site that keeps:
- Your newer projects: DiveCraft, AI Grid, Editor Tools
- Your previous (Wix-era) projects: Spirit Sealers, API Multiplayer Chat Room, Low‑poly Rat Simulator
- Dev Diaries hub and pages
- Your name in header + socials (GitHub, LinkedIn)
- No links back to Wix (this is the canonical site)

## Unity WebGL
/public/builds/divecraft/ — drop the WebGL build and link on the DiveCraft page.

## Deploy (Recipe B)
Push to GitHub → Import into Vercel → Deploy → Add your custom domain (optional).
