    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Spirit Sealers</strong> was my first-year university game project and my first full experience developing a prototype inside Unreal Engine.  
      The game is a <em>Pokémon-style top-down RPG</em> where players explore a haunted landscape filled with wandering ghosts.  
      When ghosts detect the player within range, they <strong>chase and engage</strong> them in a turn-based battle, where the player can choose to <strong>Fight</strong> or <strong>Run</strong>.  
      The focus was learning level scripting, AI behaviour trees, and combat state management through Unreal’s Blueprint system.

    <h2>Blueprint systems</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>BP_TopDownCharacter / BP_TopDownController</strong> - player input, camera follow, and movement logic for the top-down view.  </li>
      <li><strong>BP_enemy / BP_SpEnemy</strong> - ghost AI that patrols and switches to chase when the player enters range.  </li>
      <li><strong>BP_Spawner / BP_Dungeon</strong> - manages ghost spawn points and randomises encounters across the map.  </li>
      <li><strong>BattleContext</strong> - handles turn order, action selection, and outcome resolution in battle scenes. </li>
      <li><strong>GameOver</strong> - blueprint for scene transition and UI reset when the player loses or runs. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Gameplay loop</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Explore the overworld and avoid or engage roaming spirits.</li>
      <li>When contact occurs, switch to the battle arena handled by <code>BattleContext</code>.</li>
      <li>Use “Fight” to damage or “Run” to escape; ghosts re-aggro if the player returns.</li>
      <li>Winning seals the ghost; losing triggers <code>GameOver</code> UI logic.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Working entirely in Blueprint taught me the fundamentals of scripting flow, object communication, and event-driven logic.  
      It also introduced me to AI perception, collision triggers, and state-based design — all of which influenced later C# projects such as DiveCraft and AI-Grid.  
      <strong>Spirit Sealers</strong> marked the start of my interest in hybrid gameplay systems that blend exploration with reactive AI encounters.
