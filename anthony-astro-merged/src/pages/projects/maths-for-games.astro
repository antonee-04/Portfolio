    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This project was developed for my <strong>Maths for Games</strong> module in second year.
      The goal was to apply mathematical concepts directly to gameplay systems — including
      vector operations, quaternions, projectile motion, and spline-based camera movement.
      It acted as both a technical learning exercise and a chance to build reusable math
      libraries for my later projects.

    <h2>Key implementations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Custom <code>MyVector3</code> class implementing addition, dot/cross products, and magnitude/direction functions.</li>
      <li>Quaternion-to-Euler and Euler-to-Quaternion conversions coded manually for rotation testing.</li>
      <li>Projectile trajectory solver using <code>v² = u² + 2as</code> and time-stepped integration.</li>
      <li>Spline-based path interpolation for camera motion using Hermite and Bézier curves.</li>
    </ul>

    <pre class="code"><code class="language-csharp">{`// Example from MyVector3.cs
public static MyVector3 Cross(MyVector3 a, MyVector3 b)
{
    return new MyVector3(
        a.y * b.z - a.z * b.y,
        a.z * b.x - a.x * b.z,
        a.x * b.y - a.y * b.x
    );
}`}</code></pre>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      This module helped me bridge the gap between pure mathematics and interactive design.
      Writing my own vector and quaternion libraries gave me deeper control over transformations
      and paved the way for later systems such as DiveCraft’s physics-based water simulation and
      the AI grid pathfinding.
