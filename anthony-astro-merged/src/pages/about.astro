  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <section class="prose">
    <p>
      I’m <strong>Anthony Grummett</strong>, a gameplay programmer who enjoys building
      <em>systems</em> - procedural worlds, custom AI/navigation, and performance-minded tools. I work primarily in
      <strong>Unity (C#)</strong>, and I like taking features from rough prototype to something that ships and runs well.
      My portfolio mixes university modules with personal projects that push my understanding of engine internals,
      math, and low-level problem solving.
    </p>

    <h2>What I’m great at</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Systems programming:</strong> chunked terrain, greedy meshing, save/load pipelines, data-driven tooling.</li>
      <li><strong>AI / Navigation:</strong> grid graphs, A* pathfinding, terrain sampling/validation, debug visualisation.</li>
      <li><strong>Procedural generation:</strong> Perlin/Fractal noise islands, stylised block-wave systems, cave/biome hooks.</li>
      <li><strong>Performance &amp; profiling:</strong> GC churn reduction, allocations audits, frame-time stability work.</li>
      <li><strong>Networking basics:</strong> Netcode for GameObjects RPC flow, UI sync, team/visibility logic.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Selected highlights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>DiveCraft (WIP):</strong> Procedural islands + stylised block-wave simulation with chunked meshing and editor tooling.</li>
      <li><strong>AI Grid / Space Samurai Zombie Cowboy (WIP):</strong> third-year module - custom A*, low-G controller, recoil/camera bob, moving toward a lunar zombie shooter with class design.</li>
      <li><strong>API Multiplayer Chatroom:</strong> team project - chat UI, team-restricted messaging, player name/ID sync via NetworkVariables.</li>
      <li><strong>Maths for Games - Ship Builder (WIP):</strong> year-2 module - custom TRS math, grid builder, save-flight pipeline; low-G flight with spatial hashing and swept collisions.</li>
      <li><strong>Low-poly Rat Simulator:</strong> third-person feel, ragdoll toggle, tunnel traversal, URP + Cinemachine setup.</li>
      <li><strong>Spirit Sealers (Unreal, Blueprints):</strong> first-year top-down Pokémon-style prototype with ghost chase + turn-based battles.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>University of Portsmouth</strong> - Game Technology. Year 1 Modules include - 3D Modelling, Art for Games, Code Studio, Coding and Scripting for games, Game Development and Games Design
      Year 2 Modules include -  Programming APIs, Programming Systems for Games, Gameplay programming, Program Consoles (Ps5 dev kits) and Maths for Games,
      Year 3 Modules include - my Final year project (DiveCraft), Real-time Interactive Group Project (Working with Frontier Developments), Programming systems and Targeting Platforms most of which are represented in my portfolio projects with year 3 modules being ongoing.
    </p>

    <h2>Currently</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Turning the AI Grid work into a playable lunar zombie shooter with <em>Cowboy / Ninja / Astronaut</em> classes.</li>
      <li>Iterating DiveCraft’s wave phases, chunk streaming, and underwater features.</li>
      <li>Hardening my ship-builder’s Flight phase with better torque visualisation and debris clustering.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How I work</h2>
    <p>
      I keep features measurable and traceable: perf captures, allocation notes, and before/after gifs.
      I like small tools that speed up iteration (capture scripts, mesh combiners, validators) and I value readable
      debug output for AI and physics.
